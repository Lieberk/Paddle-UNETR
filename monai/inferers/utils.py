    """
    Sliding window inference on `inputs` with `predictor`.

    When roi_size is larger than the inputs' spatial size, the input image are padded during inference.
    To maintain the same spatial sizes, the output image will be cropped to the original input size.

    Args:
        inputs: input image to be processed (assuming NCHW[D])
        roi_size: the spatial window size for inferences.
            When its components have None or non-positives, the corresponding inputs dimension will be used.
            if the components of the `roi_size` are non-positive values, the transform will use the
            corresponding components of img size. For example, `roi_size=(32, -1)` will be adapted
            to `(32, 64)` if the second spatial dimension size of img is `64`.
        sw_batch_size: the batch size to run window slices.
        predictor: given input tensor `patch_data` in shape NCHW[D], `predictor(patch_data)`
            should return a prediction with the same spatial shape and batch_size, i.e. NMHW[D];
            where HW[D] represents the patch spatial size, M is the number of output channels, N is `sw_batch_size`.
        overlap: Amount of overlap between scans.
        mode: {``"constant"``, ``"gaussian"``}
            How to blend output of overlapping windows. Defaults to ``"constant"``.

            - ``"constant``": gives equal weight to all predictions.
            - ``"gaussian``": gives less weight to predictions on edges of windows.

        sigma_scale: the standard deviation coefficient of the Gaussian window when `mode` is ``"gaussian"``.
            Default: 0.125. Actual window sigma is ``sigma_scale`` * ``dim_size``.
            When sigma_scale is a sequence of floats, the values denote sigma_scale at the corresponding
            spatial dimensions.
        padding_mode: {``"constant"``, ``"reflect"``, ``"replicate"``, ``"circular"``}
            Padding mode for ``inputs``, when ``roi_size`` is larger than inputs. Defaults to ``"constant"``
            See also: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.functional.html#pad
        cval: fill value for 'constant' padding mode. Default: 0
        sw_device: device for the window data.
            By default the device (and accordingly the memory) of the `inputs` is used.
            Normally `sw_device` should be consistent with the device where `predictor` is defined.
        device: device for the stitched output prediction.
            By default the device (and accordingly the memory) of the `inputs` is used. If for example
            set to device=torch.device('cpu') the gpu memory consumption is less and independent of the
            `inputs` and `roi_size`. Output is on the `device`.
        args: optional args to be passed to ``predictor``.
        kwargs: optional keyword args to be passed to ``predictor``.

    Note:
        - input must be channel-first and have a batch dim, supports N-D sliding window.
