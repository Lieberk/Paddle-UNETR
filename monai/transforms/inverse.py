class InvertibleTransform(TraceableTransform):
    """Classes for invertible transforms.

    This class exists so that an ``invert`` method can be implemented. This allows, for
    example, images to be cropped, rotated, padded, etc., during training and inference,
    and after be returned to their original size before saving to file for comparison in
    an external viewer.

    When the ``inverse`` method is called:

        - the inverse is called on each key individually, which allows for
          different parameters being passed to each label (e.g., different
          interpolation for image and label).

        - the inverse transforms are applied in a last- in-first-out order. As
          the inverse is applied, its entry is removed from the list detailing
          the applied transformations. That is to say that during the forward
          pass, the list of applied transforms grows, and then during the
          inverse it shrinks back down to an empty list.

    We currently check that the ``id()`` of the transform is the same in the forward and
    inverse directions. This is a useful check to ensure that the inverses are being
    processed in the correct order.

    Note to developers: When converting a transform to an invertible transform, you need to:

        #. Inherit from this class.
        #. In ``__call__``, add a call to ``push_transform``.
        #. Any extra information that might be needed for the inverse can be included with the
           dictionary ``extra_info``. This dictionary should have the same keys regardless of
           whether ``do_transform`` was `True` or `False` and can only contain objects that are
           accepted in pytorch data loader's collate function (e.g., `None` is not allowed).
        #. Implement an ``inverse`` method. Make sure that after performing the inverse,
           ``pop_transform`` is called.
